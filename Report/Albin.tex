\section{Comparison of Coastal and Inland climates}
For the task not listed in the project description, a comparison is chosen. The idea is to compare the measurements of Visby, located on the small island of Gotland, to another set of measurements taken at an inland location. The produced histogram should thus highlight the differences of the two locations.

One way in which the temperature of coastal regions differs from those more inland is that the temperature changes overall more slowly. This is due to the large body of water acting as either a massive heat reservoir in the autumn of taking large amounts of energy to heat up in spring. Thus, one way to compare the locations would be to plot the temperatures in these transitional months of the year and see the temperature difference.
