[02/10/18] Forked our main repository and created a remote upstream to master branch.
Also created a branch for my work. A directory where my work can be stored was created
with this ChangeLog in it.

[04/11/18] Tried to read in the file that I am to analyze. Mainly focused on deleting
the first lines that don't have any data in them. Didn't succeed but might try later.
Moved on to focus on reading in the file and separating the variables. Now have them
separated in strings, not in integers. Can't get the quality of the data separated.

[05/11/18] We met with the entire group and tried to solve the problem with reading
in the files in a general way. We have problems with cutting off unnecassary text to
get just the data. I will continue trying to solve this in root while others try in
different ways.

[06/11/18] Albin worked with separating the text in the data file from the data while
I converted the separated variables from strings to integers/doubles. I then started
to think about how to make and plot my histogram.

[07/11/18] Incorporated code that determines mean values for each day, which is
important since I am to plot the mean temperature values for each day for an entire
year. I also added standard deviation values to each mean inside the loops that
determine the mean values. Continued to modify the code to be able to plot the
histogram.

[08/11/18] Fixed a problem with plotting, I had used the variable "day" as bins but
this variable only ranges between 0-31. Therefore I implemented a new variable
"dayCounter" that increases after every read date making it possible to draw the
histogram with temperature on the y-axis and days/bins on the x-axis.
