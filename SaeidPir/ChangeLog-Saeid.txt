First I tried to extract required data by C++ from "smhi-opendata_Lund.csv" files. 
Then I findout it is not much easy so I decide to use Bash for useful data extraction.

2018-11-05  >>>> 
My Bash script for extracting useful data out of "smhi-opendata_Lund.csv" is ready. 
My Bash script filr is uploaded and file name is "Extract data by Bash.sh". I have 
saved extracted data from "smhi-opendata_Lund.csv" file in separated .txt files and 
they are: year.txt, month.txt, day.txt, time.txt and temperature_01.txt. Only G data 
have been extracted and Y data considered as low quality data.

Based on clean data extracted by Bash I did Cpp coding in order to prepare proper data 
required for caldest and warmest days in the year histogram. In project Instruction file 
a typical output example is presented as Figure 3. Cpp file coding is uploaded as 
"Saeid_Cpp_code.C". Output of my Cpp coding are saved and uploaded as "WarmestDays.txt", 
"WarmestDays-Hist-Fig3.txt", "ColdestDays.txt" and "ColdestDays-Hist-Fig3.txt". As a 
priliminary test and before ploting data by Root warmest and coldest data are ploted by 
Excel in "Priliminary data Excel test.xlsx" which is also uploaded.
